Kernel modesetting
Modern open-source video drivers rely on kernel modesetting (KMS). 
KMS provides an improved graphical boot with less flickering, faster user 
switching, a built-in framebuffer console, seamless switching from the console 
to Xorg, and other features. KMS conflicts with legacy framebuffer drivers, which 
must remain disabled in your kernel configuration.

First, prepare your kernel for KMS. You need to do this step regardless of which 
Xorg video driver you're using.

    ## (Further down, enable basic console support. KMS uses this.)

Next, configure your kernel to use the proper KMS driver for your video card. Intel, nVidia, and AMD/ATI are the most common cards, so follow code listing for your card below.
