Filesystem in Userspace

Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) provides a way for users to mount file systems without needing special permissions (mounting in Linux is generally reserved to those with administrative privileges). 


Instalação
----------

1 - Kernel


KERNEL Enable support for FUSE

File systems  --->
    <*> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support
    

2 - Emerge

As with most file systems, after building support for the file system into the kernel be sure to install the user space tools:

# emerge --ask sys-fs/fuse


Configuração
------------

1 - Ficheiros

/etc/fuse.conf

There are two configuration variables available in the fuse.conf file:

    mount_max - Sets the maximum number of FUSE mounts allowed to non-root users (defaults to 1000 if unset).
    user_allow_other - Allows non-root users to specify the allow_other or allow_root mount options. This is disabled for security reasons.
    
    
Utilização
----------

$ fusermount -h

fusermount: [options] mountpoint
Options:
 -h                 print help
 -V                 print version
 -o opt[,opt...]   mount options
 -u                 unmount
 -q                 quiet
 -z                 lazy unmount

Montando sistemas de ficheiros

$ fusermount /path/to/mountpoint

Desmontando sistemas de ficheiros

Os sistemas de ficheiros podem ser desmontados quer usando o comando umount quer o fusermount:

$ fusermount -u /path/to/mountpoint

Desinstalação

# emerge --ask --unmerge sys-fs/fuse
